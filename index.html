    <h1>Orlando Source Software</h1>
    <p><strong>tl;dr</strong> I want us to make a venue for <strong>long-term project-based collaboration between developers of different skill levels</strong>.</p>

        <h2>For Juniors</h2>
        <h3>It's Hard to Learn Without Guidance</h3>
        <p>You graduated from a four-year program, a two-year program, or a bootcamp, or maybe you have been teaching yourself.</p>
        <p><strong>You want to keep learning</strong>, but the options seem limited:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tutorials all feel the same</strong> - you learn new syntax and hot frameworks, but not <em>how to build software at scale</em></li>
          <li><strong>Q+A sites lack context</strong> - it can be hard to get a straight answer when other developers don't know what you are trying to do</li>
          <li><strong>Building projects is great</strong> - but how do you know you're doing it right?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Employers Want Experience</h3>
        <p>Teams want to hire developers with the proven ability to</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Contribute to a large-scale project</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Function as part of a team</strong></i>
          <li><strong>Work with limited supervision</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>And there's just not enough time in a bootcamp or degree program to demonstrate those abilities to the degree many employers want.</p>
      </section>

        <h2>For Seniors</h2>
        <h3>It's Hard to Help Without Context</h3>
        <p>You have been working as a developer for a while, and you have learned a lot.</p>
        <p><strong>You want to help new developers</strong>, but how?</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Debugging is not enough</strong> - Stack Overflow and Slack are great for quick answers, not for the big picture</li>
          <li><strong>Software is built over time</strong> and yours is too limited to learn about and supervise every project out there - especially when you have projects of your own that need work</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>It's Hard to Hire Without Context</h3>
        <p>Everybody knows <strong>hiring is a mess </strong> - a long, slow process often using metrics that may not even weakly correlate with on-the-job performance. <strong>Ideally, you would hire only people who you know and trust</strong> to be able to contribute to a large-scale project as part of a team with limited supervision - but all of those people have jobs. <strong>The community needs a way to evaluate junior talent</strong> so we can help junior developers become working developers as fast as possible.</p>

    <h1>Goals of this Organization</h1>
    <p>This organization is to be <strong>a place for developers to help each other get better.</strong> Projects contributed by members of the Orlando Developer community will be built out over time to give juniors the experience of contributing to large-scale codebases. We will <strong>leverage the existing strengths of the Orlando Developer community and of GitHub:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ODev feedback is quick and friendly</strong> - if you have questions about a project, you'll be able to find maintainers in Slack and/or the local Meetups. That way you can learn what you need with less delay and stress than posting in a public forum like GitHub.</li>
      <li><strong>GitHub provides context and history</strong> - conversations in person or on Slack are great unless you need records of them later. GitHub preserves both the conversations people have about each project in the issues, and the code itself, which makes long-term communication about a project possible.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Interested? We Need You!</h1>
    <p>This organization has everything it needs to succeed except for two things: <strong>people</strong> and <strong>projects</strong>. </p>
    <p>If you would like to join in, either by <strong>offering a personal project for others to work on, volunteering to be a project maintainer, and/or working on projects,</strong> please open an issue at <a href="https://github.com/orlando-source-software/measuring-interest">the expressing interest repo</a>.</p>
    <h1>Properties of Good Projects</h1>
    <p>While I'm sure this list (and the whole organization) will evolve, these are my current thoughts about what kind of project would be a good fit for us:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Serve a Clear Purpose</strong> - both inexperienced developers who may contribute code, and seniors who will review junior work, will need be able to figure out what the project does.</li>
      <li><strong>Have Some Code</strong> - to give developers the experience of dealing with an unfamiliar, pre-existing codebase.</li>
      <li><strong>Have (GitHub) Issues</strong> - to guide initial contributions, suggest ways you would like to see the project extended.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I added one of my own projects, a React application I wrote as a way to teach myself React. <strong>It's not my best code, but what legacy code is?</strong> The point is provides a basis for other developers to contribute to an unfamiliar code base. If you are a junior and you would like to take a stab at a GitHub issue for the first time, awesome! Go fork the project and let me know if an issue is unclear. If you are one of our local JS/React stars and you'd like to suggest changes in the project architecture, sweet! <strong>I want to learn too.</strong></p>
    <p>One thing I have already learned is <strong>shipping beats perfection</strong>. I'm not at all satisfied with this page, but I want the community to see it. So we're going live!</p>
